            <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
            <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study
                as part of
                your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

                We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better
                if you
                could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the
                subjects
                fall
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated
                researcher,
                and just the
                kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
                intrigued by are
                as follows, in order of priority:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
                    (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when
                    the audience
                    size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
                <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
                the research
                to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To
                answer your question, my
                favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:

                <dt>
                    Polynesian chicken dance
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
                    around in a
                    circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Icelandic brownian shuffle
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
                    which involved
                    huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
                    tiny, very
                    rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern
                    styles such as
                    Twerking.

                    Arctic robot dance
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                    discovered a new
                    dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of
                    Northern Alaska and
                    Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
                    really cold.
